The study profiled 2.24 million cells from 122 early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients using multiplexed imaging mass cytometry (IMC). The cohort included lesions classified as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC), and radiologically as pure non-solid (PNS), part-solid (PS), and solid (S) nodules. Disease initiation is defined as the transition from adjacent-normal tissue to AIS; tumor progression is the shift from AIS to MIA and IAC. 98 matched adjacent-normal tissues were collected for comparison. Two IMC panels with 72 antibodies were used for tumor and immune characterization. During tumor initiation, B cells, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells increase, indicating heightened immune activity. Regulatory T cells (FoxP3+ Tregs) increase alongside cytotoxic CD8 T cells and CD4 T helper cells. Cytotoxic and regulatory T cell functional activity is elevated during disease progression. Adaptive immune cells are often found in Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLS), which are larger in invasive adenocarcinomas. Innate immune cells (monocytes, mast cells, macrophages, PMN-MDSCs) increase during tumor initiation but show no significant changes during later progression. Both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory innate immune cells increase during initiation. Immune modulation involves a shift across immune cell types during initiation, with adaptive immune cells continuing to be active during progression. Cytotoxic and regulatory T cells create a pro-oncogenic immune microenvironment. Immune activity is progressively suppressed in later stages, linked to increased TLS area and reduced activation markers. Significant increases in CD31+ endothelial cells, aSMA+ fibroblasts, and Vimentin+ mesenchymal cells indicate active angiogenesis and fibrosis. Epithelial cell populations shift during initiation but do not consistently increase in abundance during progression; tumor cell density does not significantly increase. Evidence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is observed, with changes in cell expression and mobility. The area occupied by epithelial/tumor microenvironments increases at initiation but not during progression. The tumor-stroma interface area expands significantly during progression. Tumor cells show enhanced interactions with each other and fibroblasts compared to normal tissue. Patient stratification identified four subgroups based on cellular densities: G1 (in-situ lesion), G2 (macrophage-enriched), G3 (inflammatory lesion), G4 (fibrotic lesion). The study proposes a binary progression model: LUAD advances through inflammation (Group 3) or fibrosis (Group 4). There is a discrepancy between CT-based assessments and histology-based subtyping for fibrotic tumors, which can be mischaracterized as mild GGOs. Fibrotic tumors (Group 4) account for 20.4% of cases and are often classified as mild but are histologically aggressive. Patients with fibrotic tumors have a significantly higher probability of having invasive adenocarcinoma compared to average. Current diagnostic procedures may underestimate the risk for patients with fibrotic LUAD. The study advocates for integrating molecular profiling with imaging and histopathology for better patient stratification and therapeutic decision-making. Potential therapeutic strategies include targeting the immune system for inflammatory lesions and targeting fibrosis/fibroblasts for fibrotic lesions.

The study aimed to uncover determinants of early lung adenocarcinoma emergence and progression by analyzing the tumor microenvironment (TME) of part-solid nodules. An integrated approach combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), multiplexed imaging mass cytometry (IMC), and spatial transcriptomics (ST) was utilized. 457,923 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes were obtained from 89 samples across 37 patients. Major cell lineages identified included epithelial, lymphoid, myeloid, endothelial, and stromal cells. 21 epithelial cell clusters were identified, including normal types (club, ciliated, AT1, AT2, basal) and malignant tumor cells. Malignant cells exhibited elevated copy number variation (CNV) scores and were enriched in both non-solid and solid components. 'Tumor transition' cells expressing markers of club and AT2 cells were identified, possibly representing early malignant cells. Transition cells demonstrated enrichment of 'glycolysis' and 'MYC targets V1' pathways, expressing protumorigenic genes (SPINK1, MDK, AQP3, CEACAM5). Tumor cells could be classified as 'AT2-like' or 'club-like' based on gene signatures, suggesting heterogeneity linked to cell-of-origin. Non-solid tumor cells showed upregulation of genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), drug resistance, and tumor growth. Solid tumor cells exhibited upregulation of metastasis-promoting genes and pathways compared to non-solid components. EGFR-mutated tumor cells expressed more MHC class I/II genes than KRAS-mutated tumors, indicating an early-stage immune response balance. Increased CD4 T cells and decreased NK cells were observed in non-solid compared to normal and solid components. CD8 T cells showed a progressive decrease in cytotoxic clusters in non-solid and solid components. Increased abundance of exhausted CD8 and CD4 T cell clusters was noted in non-solid and solid components. Tregs were more abundant in non-solid compared to normal and solid components, with specific subclusters indicating high suppressive scores. M2-like macrophages increased in non-solid components, with associated poor prognosis markers. Dendritic cells (DCs) showed increased abundance and antigen-presenting capabilities in non-solid compared to normal and solid components. Endothelial cells in nodules exhibited increased proangiogenic gene expressions and decreased immunomodulatory gene expressions. Increased myofibroblasts and pericyte/smooth muscle cells were noted in solid components, with ECM remodeling continuing. Tumor cells influenced TME alterations via various signaling pathways, promoting angiogenesis and immunosuppression. Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLSs) were present in both components, with variations in activated and exhausted T cell densities. The study identified potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, including inhibitory receptors on T cells, NK cell activity enhancement, and anti-angiogenic therapies.
