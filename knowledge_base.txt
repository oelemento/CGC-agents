The study profiled 2.24 million cells from 122 early-stage lung adenocarcinoma patients using multiplexed imaging mass cytometry. The cohort included surgically resected lesions classified as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC), and as pure non-solid (PNS), part-solid (PS), and solid (S) nodules. Disease initiation is defined as the transition from adjacent-normal tissue to AIS, and tumor progression as the shift from AIS to MIA and IAC. Adaptive immunity shows an increase in B cells, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells during the transition from adjacent-normal to tumor tissue, with a continued increase during progression from AIS to IAC. Innate immune cells increase primarily during tumor initiation but do not show significant changes during later progression. Significant increases in CD31+ endothelial cells, aSMA+ fibroblasts, and Vimentin+ mesenchymal cells occur, indicating active angiogenesis, fibrosis, and wound healing. Epithelial cell populations shift significantly during initiation but do not show a consistent increase in overall abundance during progression. Evidence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs, with shifts in epithelial/mesenchymal cell proportions and reciprocal expression of PanCK and Vimentin. The tumor-stroma interface area significantly expands during progression, indicating pronounced stromal proliferation. Hierarchical clustering identified four patient subgroups based on cellular densities: G1 (In-situ lesion), G2 (Macrophage-enriched), G3 (Inflammatory lesion), G4 (Fibrotic lesion). A binary progression model suggests LUAD advances either through inflammation (Group 3) or fibrosis (Group 4). There is a discrepancy between CT-based radiological assessment and histology-based subtyping, particularly for fibrotic tumors, which may be mischaracterized as mild GGOs. The study advocates for integrating molecular profiling with imaging and histopathology for improved patient stratification and therapeutic decision-making.

The study aimed to uncover early lung adenocarcinoma emergence and progression determinants by analyzing tumor microenvironments. Techniques used included single-cell RNA sequencing, imaging mass cytometry, and spatial transcriptomics. The study differentiated between non-solid (preinvasive) and solid (invasive) components of part-solid nodules. A total of 457,923 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes were analyzed from 89 samples across 37 patients. Identified cell types included epithelial, lymphoid, myeloid, endothelial, and stromal cells. Malignant cells displayed elevated copy number variation and were enriched in non-solid and solid components. Tumor transition cells expressing both club and AT2 cell markers were identified, potentially representing early malignant cells. Glycolysis and MYC targets V1 pathways were enriched in transition cells. Tumor cells were categorized as 'AT2-like' or 'club-like,' suggesting heterogeneity linked to cell origin. Non-solid tumor cells upregulated genes linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, drug resistance, and tumor growth. Solid tumor cells showed upregulation of metastasis-promoting genes and pathways like oxidative phosphorylation and interferon response. Changes in lymphoid and myeloid cell dynamics included altered abundance and characteristics across nodule components. Endothelial and stromal cell dynamics also varied, with changes in gene expression and pathway activation relevant to cancer progression. Spatial transcriptomics and imaging mass cytometry provided additional insights into the cellular interactions and microenvironment changes. Identified potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for early intervention in lung cancer progression.
